  \begin{itemize}
    \item Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering student with 5 over years of programming experience in both software and hardware development projects.
    \item Proficient in C, C++, Python and Lua, with expertise in industry-standard tools like CMake, Git, and Docker.
    \item Member of AICS Lab, contributing to several AI projects including ``Document skew correction", ``English grammar correction" and ``Optical Character Recognition".
    \item Authored an IEEE paper on ``A novel deep learning based method for Vietnamese ID card skew correction".

  % Identified career goal as an AI engineer.

  % As an Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering student, I have been working in the field of programming for 5 years.
  % Throughout those years, I have done various projects about software development ("Student Management System", "Bank Management System") as well as hardware development ("Home Security Alarm", "Audio Spectrum Visualizer", "RISC Stored-Program Machine") using mainly C and C++ language.
  % Additionally, I taught myself some of the industry-standards tools for programming, such as CMake, Git, Docker.
  % Currently, I am a member of the AICS Lab (founded by Mr.
  % Võ Lê Cường), participated on several AI related projects namely "ID card skew correction", "Document‑Table skew correction", "Optical Character Recognition".
  % My most recent project is "Spelling and Grammar correction application".
  %
  % Five years ago, I got accepted into HUST, barely know what my interests are.
  % However, after just one year, as I start to study some of the foundational courses, I quickly developed a passion for programming.
  % Since then, I have been continuously learning and advancing my knowledge in programming.
  % Unfortunately, my major does not primarily focus on programming, leading to an imbalance in my grades and resulting in a relatively low CPA.
  % Perhaps, my most noticeable weakness is my inability to multitask; I can only efficiently focus on one task at a time.
  % Productivity decreases significantly when dealing with more than two tasks simultaneously.
  % On the flip side, I can self-study new concepts pretty quickly, which I think it is a crucial skill to have when it comes to programming.
  % Overall, I consider myself fortunate to have found my passion, because as an ancient Chinese philosopher said, "Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life".
  % With these skills and weaknesses in mind, I have identified my desired career path as a software engineer/embedded engineer.
  % I believe Samsung R\&D Center Vietnam is an ideal place to start my career, because Samsung is one of the leading technology companies in Vietnam.
  % Furthermore, having undertaken an internship at SRV, I found myself quickly adapting to the professional and dynamic working environment at Samsung.
